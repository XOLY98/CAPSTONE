    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>The Xhosa's are a proud people and their cultural heritage is close to their hearts. Traditionally, the women's clothing and ornaments show the stages of their lives. A certain headdress is worn by a newly married girl; a different style by one who has given birth to her first child, and so on. Women's clothing include dresses in bright colours like orange, green, red and white with braiding and beads over a skirt. The headdress is a colourful braided turban. 

        The Xhosa people are known for their beautiful beadwork and it forms an important part of women's traditional clothing. They wear long necklaces of beads, with collars of multi-coloured beads around the neck, as well as beaded arm and ankle bracelets. 
        
        Other beaded items include ithumbu (the elaborate bead necklace worn by Xhosa women when they perform a traditional dance or iqakabod), iqoqo (a decorative, tasselled and beaded band worn around the lower back), the vulwakabini (a beaded top worn over the upper body and breasts) and isidlokolo (an animal skin hat decorated with large beads and used by healers in traditional dance or when working with patients).
        
        Xhosa women smoking decorative pipes is a familiar sight in some areas of the Eastern Cape. The pipes are usually made from wood and often decorated with beads</p>

    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p class="about">THE TRIBE Africa is a South African beading brand founded in 2023 by Xolelwa Manqina. This was with the desire to explore beading design solutions that would be suitable for women.
        Our initial vision was to create a modern Xhosa-inspired beading collection that would be suitable for this market. As a person that loves and embraces her tibe Xolelwa felt that he had to develop premium beading that celebrates traditional Xhosa aesthetics.<br>Along our journey into exploring astonishing traditional Xhosa beadwork patterns, symbolism and colours, we discovered that they would be the best source of inspiration for knitwear, which we then reinterpreted into modern knitwear.
        THE TRIBE designs showcase the beauty, culture, language and aspiration of the Xhosa people. Evolved and amended in a modern way and a current design context it translates into a form that resonates with multiple fashion markets globally.
        Our Brand Aspire to become a leading African lux, premium and mass heritage fashion & lifestyle brand.</p>
